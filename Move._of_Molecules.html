  <p>
    The universe is in a constant case of movement, nothing is stationary, specially: Molecules.
  </p>
  <p>
      To say that they are necessary for life would be an understatement, water, oxygen, carbon dioxide are all examples of molecules to name a few. Thus, understanding how they behave and why they behave in a certain pattern, specially when speaking about their interactions with organic environments, is necessary to understand life itself. 
  </p>
  <p>
    But before we strat diving into the world of molecules, there are some key concepts one must understand and they are:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><span class="bold">Concentration:</span> the number of molecules in a given volume. </li>
    <li><span class="bold">Concentration gradient:<span class="bold"></span> the difference in concentration between two areas, the greater the difference in concentration the “the steeper” the gradient. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Now that the basic is covered , let's begin! </p>

  <section>
    <h6 class="bold">1. Simple Diffusion</h6>    
    <h6 class="underline">What is Simple Diffusion? </h6>
    <p>
      It is the movement of molecules from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Molecules, therefore, <span class="bold"> go down a concentration gradient,</span> as a result of <span class="bold">random movement.</span>  <br>
      <br>This is a <span class="bold">passive</span> process, meaning it does not require energy (ATP) to occur and it will only end after all molecules are evenly dispersed, reaching <span class="bold">equilibrium.</span>     
    </p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qBig2wevHhw" title="Diffusion Animation" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>
      The principle of simple diffusion is the same in living cells, however, cells are surrounded by a partially permeable membrane that has the ability to restrict the free, random, movement of certain molecules. <br>
      <br>A partially permeable membrane means that the membrane allows some molecules to cross it easily, such as oxygen (O2) and others with difficulty, such as water (H2O), or just not at all, such as glucose (C6H12O6).
    </p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_v0MRZxU2bc" title="Simple Diffusion Animation" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>
      The size of the molecules is an important factor in whether it is able to diffuse through the partially permeable membrane or not.  
    </p>

    <section>
      <h6 class="bold underline">Why is diffusion important in living organisms?</h6>    
      <p>
        Diffusion is necessary for many biological processes such as cell nutrition, oxygen delivery and waste removal. Some examples of simple diffusion within the human body include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="bold">Food absorption</span> in the <span class="bold">villi (singular villus)</span> of the intestines:</li>
        <img src="/images/Cell Biology_7a.png" alt="Food absorption" class="image">
        <p>
          Digested food, which has been broken down into its monomers through digestion, enters the villi through simple diffusion. This occurs because food particles gravitate from the passing chyme (a mix of food monomers and digestive juice that travels through the intestines) into the blood capillaries that are found inside the villi. This is in turn possible because said capillaries do not contain a lot of food particles, making it an area of low concentration; and the chyme, on the other hand, is basically food particles, making it an area of high concentration. This is what we refer to as food absorption.<br>
          <br> Nonetheless, this is not the only simple diffusion that happens. As shown in the diagram above, the food monomers diffuse from the arterioles (artery capillaries) into the venule (vein capillaries) where they will in turn be taken to the liver so they can be inspected.
        </p>

        <p class="textbox listTextbox">
          Genius Aside<img src="/images/GeniusAsideGraduationCap.png" class="GeniusAside" class="image"> <br>
          <br>If you are unsure about what monomers are please refer to <i>Carbohydrates, Fats (Lipids) and Proteins</i>. 
        </p>
        <li>In the <span class="bold">alveoli</span> of the lungs, <span class="bold">gas exchange</span> (carbon dioxide leaves the bloodstream, oxygen enters) happens due to simple diffusion. </li>
        <img src="/images/Cell Biology_7c.png" alt="Lungs" class="image">
        <p>
          Once again the same concept is applied. All the blood a body contains passes through the alveoli (shown in the diagram above), which are found in the lungs, in order for gas exchange to happen. This process is of the utmost importance as it is what allows cells to have the oxygen it requires for cellular respiration and to get rid of respiration waste product: carbon dioxide, which can be harmful if found in large quantities. <br>
          <br> Finally, the air you just breath is 21 % Oxygen (O2) and only 0.04% Carbon Dioxide (CO2 ).<br>
          <br> Thus, once the blood rich in carbon dioxide  arrives at the alveoli, a concentration gradient is formed. There is more O2in the inhaled air than in the blood and more CO2 in the bloodstream than in the breathed in air. Consequently, simple diffusion of both gases happen at the same time; the end result is a bloodstream now oxygen rich and an exhaled air composed of 16% O2, 4%  CO2  and other gases. 
        </p>
      </ol>

      <h6 class="bold underline">What factors influence the rate of Simple Diffusion? </h6>
      <p>
        The rate refers to the speed at which something happens, and there are five  main factors that influence the rate of simple diffusion, they are: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="bold">Surface area to Volume ratio </li>
        <p>
          The smaller the cell or structure, the bigger its surface-to-volume ratio. This is because the smaller the entity the less volume it contains, which means that it has more surface area. Consequently, the more surface area a cell has the more space molecules have to enter. Due to this fact, some cells have specialised structures in order to have an increased surface area, such as the microvilli (villi of a villus) in the small intestines that have the function of absorbing nutrients.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/Cell Biology_7d.png" alt="Intestinal Folds" class="image">
        <li class="bold">Temperature </li>
        <p>
          Temperature affects the kinetic energy of the molecules in the solution. The higher the temperature, the faster the molecules move, since they have more energy. Meaning they will collide more frequently with the cell membrane, increasing the rate of movement across it. 
        </p>
        <p>The following video helps visualise the effect of temperature on molecules: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7fqf7t-fOHI">YouTube</a> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make them add a heat source into the molecules and see how faster the molecules get  </li>
        </ul>
          <li class="bold">Molecular Size</li>
        <p>he larger the particle, the more subjected to greater resistance within the medium. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make them increase the size of the molecule and see how much harder it is to make it through the cell membrane </li>
        </ul>
          <li class="bold">Steepness of Gradient </li>
        <p>
          The higher the concentration of a solution, the steeper the gradient, the faster the rate of simple diffusion. The greater the difference in concentration the more random collisions against the membrane will occur. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make them add more molecules into the diagram and see how the frequency of collisions increase and therefore the rate increases </li>
        </ul>
          <li class="bold">Distance (Thickness of the Membrane)</li>
        <p>
          The shorter the distance (the thinner the membrane) the molecules have to travel through, the faster the molecules can cross the membrane, thus, the faster the rate. This is the reason alveoli and blood capillaries are one cell thick, to ensure the rate of simple diffusion can be as fast as possible. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make them decrease the cell thickness from an artery to a capillary thus showing how faster the molecules travel alongside the gradient. </li>
        </ul>

    <h6 class="bold">2. Osmosis </h6>
    <p>In order to understand osmosis, there are a few concepts we must comprehend first. They are: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A <span class="bold">solution</span> is when a substance, referred as <span class="bold">solute</span>, is dissolved into another one, referred as <span class="bold">solvent.</span> Water dilutes most solutes easily (please refer to <i>Water</i> for more information) therefore, it is highly used as a solvent, so much that it is known as the <span class="bold">universal solvent.</span></li>
      <li>A <span class="bold">diluted solution</span> indicates that the solution has a higher concentration, in this case,  of water than of the solute. </li>
      <li>A <span class="bold">concentrated solution</span> means the solution has a higher concentration of the solute than, in this case, water. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now that we understand the basics… </p>

    <section>
      <h6 class="bold underline">What is Osmosis?</h6>
      <p>
        Osmosis is the simple diffusion of free water molecules from an area of high concentration (dilute solution) to an area of low concentration (concentrated solution) through a partially permeable membrane until equilibrium is reached, meaning that there are relatively the same amount of water molecules in both areas that are being separated by the membrane. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As stated previously, all living cells are surrounded by a partially permeable membrane and water is capable of moving freely through it via osmosis. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to osmosis, water moves <em>down</em> its concentration gradient. The main reason why osmosis occurs rather than simple diffusion is because solutes cannot cross the partially permeable cell membrane without aid, thus in other to find equilibrium the water molecules are the ones that must travel across and stable both solutions (the two solutions separated by the membrane).
      </p>
      <img src="/images/Cell Biology_7e.png" alt="Solution" class="image">
    </section>
    <section>
      <h6 class="bold underline">What is the Importance of Osmosis in Tissues?</h6>
      <p>
        Osmosis will only stop after equilibrium is reached, this may sound like a good thing since the majority of our time and energy is spent in homeostasis. However, depending on the environment the cell is in, osmosis can have a negative impact, as too much or too little water will influence the shape of a cell,  consequently limiting its abilities to perform its assigned roles. 
      </p>
      <p>There are three types of solutions/environments a cell can find be in:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="bold">Isotonic,</span> where the concentration of water molecules is equal on both solutions being separated by a partially permeable membrane. </li>
        <li><span class="bold">Hypotonic,</span> where there is a higher concentration of water in the solution outside the partially permeable membrane. </li>
        <li><span class="bold">Hypertonic:</span> where there is a higher concentration of water in the solution inside the partially permeable membrane. </li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section class="textbox">
      <h6 id="heading">Genius Aside <img src="/images/GeniusAsideGraduationCap.png" class="GeniusAside"></h6>
      <p>
        These definitions, which are specific to osmosis, can change slightly in other subjects, such as Chemistry. For instance, an isotonic solution means a solution where the amount of solute and solvent is the same. The overall idea remains the same, however, when speaking about osmosis, it is important to understand that the solutions are being separated by a partially permeable membrane.

      <h6 class="bold underline">The Effects of Osmosis on Animal Cells</h6>
      <p>
        What exactly happens to animal cells when found in these three different solutions/environments? 
      </p>
      <p>
        In an isotonic solution, there will be no net of movement of the molecules since they are already in equilibrium (normal conditions)
      </p>
      <p>
        In a hypotonic solution, there will be an influx of water molecules into the cell since there are more water molecules outside than inside the cell. Consequently, the cell will <span class="bold">lyse</span> as it gets increasingly bigger until it bursts, causing the cell to die. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In a hypertonic solution, there will be an exodus of water molecules from the cell, due to the fact that there are more water molecules inside the cell than outside. As a result, the cell will <span class="bold">shrivel</span>. 
      </p>
      <img src="/images/Cell Biology_7f.png" alt="Blood Cells" class="image">
    </section>
    <section>
      <h6 class="bold underline">What are the Effects of Osmosis on Plant Cells? </h6>
      <p>
        In a hypotonic solution, water will enter the cell making the vacuole expand, which consequently pushes the cell membrane against the cell wall, making the cell <i>firm</i> and <i>rigid</i> <span class="bold">(turgid)</span>. This <span class="bold">turgor pressure</span>, the pressure from the cell membrane against the cell wall, is highly important as it is what provides support and strength for the plant. For instance, it allows the plant to remain upright to catch as much sunlight as possible. Furthermore, it is important to know that the pressure created by the cell wall impedes too much water from entering the cell, thus, preventing the cell to lyse (normal conditions).
      </p>
      <p>
        In an isotonic solution, there would not be a net movement of water molecules as equilibrium has already been found. This does not allow for the cell to hold on to water, decreasing the turgor pressure and therefore, preventing her to become turgid. It is not ideal for a plant cell to be in this environment, thus, it is said that they are <span class="bold">flaccid</span>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In a hypertonic solution, there will be an exodus of water molecules from the cell, causing the vacuole and the cytoplasm to shrink. Consequently, the cell membrane detaches from the cell wall. When this happens, the cell has become <span class="bold">plasmolysed</span>.

    <h6 class="bold">3. Active Transport </h6>
    <section>
      <h6 class="underline">What is active transport? </h6>
      <p>
        Active transport is the movement of particles from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration and it <em>requires</em> ATP (energy generated from respiration). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since active transport moves molecules <em>against</em> a concentration gradient, it needs a protein pump (a carrier protein) that is embedded into the cellular membrane, called integral proteins, to be the means of transportation of the molecules, as well as energy. This required energy is generated through the direct <span class="bold">hydrolysis</span> of ATP ( the breaking down of the molecule).  
      </p>
      <p>
        Active transport is an important process because there are some molecules that are too big to be able to travel through the partially-permeable membrane by itself,  such as sugars and proteins. Furthermore, there are occasions that a molecule, such as glucose, must enter the cell even if the cell already has more glucose than its surroundings.  
      </p>
      <p>The overall process of this <span class="bold">active process</span> is: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>he molecule that wants to cross the membrane will bind to its specific protein pump on either side of the partly permeable membrane.</li>
        <li>An ATP molecule will also bind to the carrier and be hydrolysed, causing a conformational change, which is a change in the shape of the structure. This is what energy expenditure is. </li>

            <br>There are a lot of biological processes that require energy to be completed. The energy needed comes from the hydrolysis (the breaking down of a chemical bond by water ) of ATP into into ADP +Pi (Piis a phosphate group). When the bond is broken it releases the energy that was being stored in it. 
        </p>
        <li>This allows the primary molecule to travel across the cell membrane (to be translocated), against its gradient.</li>
        <li>Molecule is finally released. </li>

      <h6 class="bold underline">What are some examples of active transport? </h6>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">The Sodium-Potassium Pump</span> is an integral protein that performs one of the most vital forms of active transport in the human body. In this exchange process, three sodium ions are removed from the cell while two potassium ions are introduced to it. 
      </p>
      <p>This process involves six main steps: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>ree sodium ions bind to the sodium-potassium pump</li>
        <li>An ATP molecule binds into the pump and is followed by its hydrolysis into ADP +Pi. The phosphate group (Pi) remains attached to the pump. This is the energy expenditure phase. </li>
        <li>The pump undergoes a conformational change translocating sodium across the membrane. </li>
        <li>The conformational change allows two potassium ions to bind to the surface of the pump</li>
        <li>The Pi (phosphate group) is finally released causing the pump to return to its original shape</li>
        <li>This translocates the potassium across the membrane, completing the ion exchange. </li>
      </ol>
